I am an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Arlington. My research focus on the intersection of security & privacy with cyber-physical systems, medical healthcare, software engineering, and machine learning. I am especially interested in data-driven security and privacy analysis in cross-platform interaction of emerging systems and platforms. The goal of my research is to measure the attack surface of the IoT platforms, analyze privacy leakages among inter-connected home automation applications, privacy leakages in medical healthcare, and investigate the enforcement of privacy policies. My work has been published in several top tier security & privacy and system conferences, including- NDSS, UBICOMP/IMWUT, WWW, PoPETs, SOUPS. My research findings are acknowledged by several well-known companies (such as., Google) and resulted in the publishing of several CVEs. I am fortunate to receive a few awards and recognition during his Ph.D., including- CPS Rising Stars, UVA endowed graduate fellowship award, Link Lab outstanding graduate research award, and several travel grants.
I received my PhD at University of Virginia (UVA) under the supervision of Professor Yuan Tian in 2023. I interned at Baidu Research (with Dr. Ping Li and Dr. Yingjie Lao). Before joining UVA, I was a software engineer (in security lab) at Kona Software Lab ltd in Bangladesh. I have completed my bachelorâ€™s degree from the Computer Science and Engineering department of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 2016.
